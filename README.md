### Hi there, I'm Antonio Giuseppe Doronzo 👋

I'm a passionate Computer Scientist from Italy, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence & High Performance Computing Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I graduated with honors (110/110 cum laude) in Computer Science from the University of Bari, and I'm deeply driven by challenges in AI, numerical methods, and scientific computing.

- 🧠 I love rigorous problem-solving, from theoretical foundations of applied mathematics to practical challenges in machine learning and HPC.
- 💼 I'm currently working as a software developer at **Technology Reply Srl**.
- 📚 I enjoy bridging the gap between theory and practice, and I value clarity, depth, and curiosity in both academic and professional settings.
- 🛠️ I'm especially interested in applied machine learning, data-driven modeling, and scientific computing, both in research and real-world applications.
- 🌱 Lifelong learner: I continuously expand my skill set through university studies, side projects, and exploration of technical literature.
